you have discovered the concept of "yeah nah", where you're alive, but you discovered cause and affect




    Way to hit rock bottom, and all it took was a wobble before your 27th birthday. 

    Yet somehow you saw yourself heading in to the abyss.
    
    So you heard a bad rumour about yourself, and then it came true?




    ( the curse is in fact prolonged )
    ( absolutely winging it )



Build it back up bro, improve, make a move

Dude, you've had that thing as your phone background for so long, go see why it meant so much to you






    
    As far as I can tell, it's 
    
    six years since you met everyone in this picture, 
    six years since you became bizzaro man at a festival
    five years since you travelled and graduated
    five years since you flew back and flubbed it
    four years since having a promising career in IT
    four years since being crushed under lockdown
    three years since a taste of construction
    three years since a good introduction  
     [ nothing was the same
    two years since a not quite career
     [ you've got internet cookie brain
    two years since a lofty welcome, you got this shit, you're in
     [ in good
     [ in uhoh
    one year since a big win,
     [ did what you wanted, but you know there was a disconnect
    six months since "I'm not sure how to recover from this one"
     [ maladaptive daydreaming; you feel what you need to feel
     [ fait accompli - oh yes you see every step of it this time
     [ you can't say, but now it's part of your narrative



Now what? 

it's always darkest before the dawn

    Step up. You have the ability to rise above, but know just how hard you're going to have to make up for it. Some things won't get answered, some things will be learned.
