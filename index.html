OK, you let the domain lapse, but you still want to document something, and this is as sensible a place as it gets?






    What the hell man.









    Way to hit rock bottom, and all it took was a wobble before your 27th birthday. 



























    Yet somehow you saw yourself heading in to the abyss,
    


























    This time, a curse that got rolling at the first of the year? 

    Fuuuuuuuck

    ( the curse is in fact prolonged )
    ( a cut narrative, uh woah 
    [ absolutely winging it 
    [ just holding out for something
    [ he don't wanna be saved

    Build it back up bro
    So improve, make a move
    Dude, you've had that thing as your phone background for so long, go see why it meant so much to you




    

    You got the cursed coming out story, clean it up
    And you want to have this hanging over you for how long? 





    
    As far as I can tell, it's 
    
    six years since you met everyone in this picture, 
    six years since you became bizzaro man at a festival
    five years since you travelled and graduated
    five years since you flew back and flubbed it
    four years since having a promising career in IT
    four years since being crushed under lockdown
    three years since a taste of construction
    three years since a heavy introduction
     [ nothing was the same
    two years since a not quite career
     [ you've got internet cookie brain
    two years since a lofty welcome, you got this shit, you're in
     [ in good
     [ in uhoh
    one year since a big win,
     [ did what you wanted, but you know there was a disconnect
    six months since "I'm not sure how to recover from this one"
     [ maladaptive daydreaming; you feel what you need to feel
     [ fait accompli - oh yes you see every step of it this time
     [ you can't say, but now it's part of your narrative




    Now what? 

    Step up. You have the ability to rise above, but know just how hard you're going to have to make up for it. 
    
    Some things won't get answered, some things will be learned, but bro that's bleak













    





    
    Some things won't get answered, some things will be learned, but bro (bleak failure feeling


    Snap out of it, you know you're better than this, but aw man does it suck to see you like that




























    drooooooonnnnnnnnnngggggggoooooo 
    
    go go go
